KindleForge is a GUI Appstore for Kindles, allowing you to download & install tweaks & applications such as KOReader directly on-device, without having to keep copying files locally.

> Ensure you are on the latest hotfix prior to installation! Older hotfixes could potentially cause bricks! As always, jailbreak at your own risk ;)

1. Grab the lastest file from releases
2. Unzip it, paste both `KindleForge/` and `KindleForge.sh` into the `documents/` folder on your Kindle.
3. Run the scriptlet, and have fun!

## Features

- Reliable installation flow
- Smooth scroll, pretty frontend & UI
- Multiple packages

## Minimum Requirements

- AdBreak, WinterBreak, or LanguageBreak
- Latest Universal Hotfix
- Above the 5.13.7 firmware (at present - to be lowered)
- Both **hard-float and soft-float** kindles should work, but not all packages may support both architectures.

## Troubleshooting

Try reloading multiple times, rebooting, or re-copying assets from the latest release and trying again.

### KindleForge

**Q: The KindleForge scriptlet doesn't appear!**

A: Ensure you have copied `KindleForge.sh` into your documents folder. If this is true, and the scriptlet still isn't showing, then reinstall the latest hotfix using the steps above.

**Q: When I click on the scriptlet, it says "Application Error!"**

A: Chances are, you've installed KindleForge incorrectly. **BOTH the folder AND scriptlet MUST be in the `documents` folder on your kindle!** 

**Q: I keep getting core dumps & crashlogs generated when using KindleForge/Scriptlets!**

A: You must be on the latest hotfix, 2.3.1+. Use the steps mentioned above to reinstall hotfix

**Q: No apps load and I'm getting "Unknown ABI!"**

A: This happens commonly after you fix the core dump issue, please use the "Update KForge" functionality in-app to resolve. 

If this doesn't work:

1. Remove:
   -  documents/KindleForge.sh
   -  documents/KindleForge
2. Reboot
3. Re-install with the above steps.

**Q: App is installing/uninstalling forever!**

A: Could be caused by a multitude of issues such as beginning the install without wifi, DNS stuff. You can press "refresh packages" in the top bar to clear the lock and retry, or reboot.
